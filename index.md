## Progress Report 1 - Prepared 10/2/2020

# Accomplishments for This Reporting Period:
Properly installed Unreal Engine, though onto a less powerful secondary computer, rather than primary.

Began proper concepting of game, including consultation with interested parties and potential playtesters, assembly of a more extensive list of features, further genre specialization, and assembly of more specific influences for planned game mechanics.

Assembled playlist of Unreal Engine tutorials to assist with development and to remedy unexpected gaps in memory and skill due to the amount of time that has passed since my last attempt at using the engine.  
Resolved technical issues with primary computer that prevented proper installation of Unreal Engine, allowing me to take advantage of the increased power of the primary computer.


# Accomplishments Planned but Not Completed This Reporting Period:
Planned to make significant modifications to side-scroller template provided by default within Unreal Engine, including modifications to game physics and implementation of several new assets.

Planned to at least partially reverse-engineer side-scroller template to produce a basic side-scroller from scratch, to allow for easier modifications as development continues

Planned to have reached 60 hours worked during this reporting period.

Planned to update GitHub website to coincide with weekly time logs, as was required. Unfortunately neglected to do so.


# Root Cause of Variances:
The root cause of these variances is primarily poor time management due to my own inefficiencies in regards to my other coursework, which often has overlapping due dates with the weekly time logs. This personal inefficiency results in significantly more time being spent on this coursework from my other classes than likely should be, making it difficult to allow for a proper amount of time to be spent on this project. I do not present this as a justification for making much slower progress on the project than initially intended or likely expected, but as an acknowledgement of the personal flaw which has led to this outcome.   


# Impact to Upcoming Milestones or Project Due Date:
Potential impacts to upcoming milestones or project due date are presently impossible to measure, due to unexpected differences between previously expected amount of accomplishments by this time and actual amount of accomplishments by this time. In addition, project due date is inflexible by nature, as it should be, meaning that the impact of my progress thus far upon it is negligible. What I can provide is an assurance that the project will be completed by the final due date, though significantly more time may need to be spent than expected, as I would otherwise need to trim out several initially planned features, something I am highly reluctant to do. In other words, the time spent on the project between now and future milestones will need to be greatly increased in order to bring the project “back on track,” as it were. Planned steps for doing so will be listed below.


# Planned Corrective or Preventive Action:
Assemble more detailed list of milestones, including detailed “sub-milestones” to complete between primary milestones.

Address personal inefficiencies in other coursework to ensure adequate time can be devoted to project development.

Spend at least one full week of next reporting period exclusively on more in-depth Unreal Engine tutorials, to gain additional familiarity and mastery for the purpose of accelerating project development.

Website updates for Time Logs 1 and 2 will be done retroactively as soon as possible to correct their earlier omission, and both TIme Log 3 and all future time logs will coincide with website updates.


# Summary of Upcoming Tasks
Upcoming tasks for the coursework include creating Demo Videos 1 and 2, the production of additional time logs, and the production of a project performance report for the next reporting period.

Specific upcoming tasks for the project itself include modifications to the physics of the side-scroller template, modifying the textures of the side-scroller template, implementing the basic desired features in the side scroller template such as combat, recreating the template from scratch, then replacing the models and textures to establish the desired aesthetic for the final game. After this is done, I will consult the individuals who contributed ideas initially for further opinions about the game, and attempt to enlist some of them for playtesting, to hopefully eliminate any bugs that arise during development and identify any areas in which the game is particularly lacking, such as design mistakes or suggestions to make it more entertaining.


# Accomplishments Planned for Next Reporting Period
The accomplishments planned for the next reporting period are to achieve at least 90 hours worked on the project to bring myself back on track, to implement the modifications of the side-scroller template that were mentioned above, and to create the two demo videos that were also mentioned above. 


# New Risks Identified/Risk
No major risks have made themselves apparent over the course of this first reporting period. This will hopefully remain the case.


# Issues

The only issues that I was able to identify over the course of this first reporting period were my own inefficiencies with external coursework and the technical problem which prevented me from installing the Unreal Engine on my more powerful primary computer. This second issue has now been resolved, and I intend for the former issue to be resolved before the end of the second reporting period.


# Comments

I would like to be very clear about the fact that this project has proven to be almost exactly as challenging as I had expected when initially choosing to undertake it. Despite this, factors I should have already accounted for have caused delays in the project’s development that I intend to rectify as soon as possible. Completion of this project should still be quite feasible, but I am quite certain that I will regret my failure to account for those factors in the later stages of this project, when any lost time in early stages of the project feels even more significant. 

As I become more familiar with the Unreal Engine over the course of this project, I should most likely be able to complete my planned tasks much more quickly. This week’s accomplishment of resolving the technical issue that prevented me from installing the engine on my more powerful computer should also assist in the acceleration of project development, as the more powerful computer should be less prone to inconsistent frame rates and freezing.
